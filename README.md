collecting gaze data?”

## Abstract:

Automatic detection of cognates helps downstream NLP tasks of Machine Translation,
Cross-lingual Information Retrieval, Computational Phylogenetics and Cross-lingual Named
Entity Recognition. Previous approaches for
the task of cognate detection use orthographic,
phonetic and semantic similarity based features sets. In this paper, we propose a novel
method for enriching the feature sets, with cognitive features extracted from human readers’
gaze behaviour. We collect gaze behaviour
data for a small sample of cognates and show
that extracted cognitive features help the task
of cognate detection. However, gaze data collection and annotation is a costly task. We use
the collected gaze behaviour data to predict
cognitive features for a larger sample and show
that predicted cognitive features, also, significantly improve the task performance. We report improvements of 10% with the collected
gaze features, and 12% using the predicted
gaze features, over the previously proposed
approaches. Furthermore, we release the collected gaze behaviour data along with our code
and cross-lingual models.
